# bot-homer-simpson

bot for fox's channel

# To run on localhost

First you need the credentials to authorize the watson's api. See the .env.sample, to know which credentials you might need.

Remember that to run properly the application, you need to update the version of your bot, everytime you have a new intent, entites, or dialogs from Watson. To do that look in to the file app.js e change the line

`version: '2018-8-03'`

## To run the bot:

Your Localhost's port is 4000
`run the command: node app.js`
